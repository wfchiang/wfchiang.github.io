> Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; In whose heart are the highways to Zion.
> Passing through the valley of Weeping they make it a place of springs; Yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings.
> They go from strength to strength; Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.
> O Jehovah God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob. [Psalms84:5-8]
