Identities of mine: 
1. Christian
2. Software Engineer 
3. "Free" Software Researcher

As a Christian, Jesus Christ is my Shepherd. People who know me personally witness my sin. But I believe Jesus may pardon my sin and accept me in His kingdom. 

As a Software Engineer, I was trained to model business requirements into software solutions. Hands-on implementation is also my strength.

As a "free" software researcher, I love to explore novel ideas in fields like computation model and software testing.
