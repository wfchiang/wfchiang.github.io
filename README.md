> Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; In whose heart are the highways to Zion.
> Passing through the valley of Weeping they make it a place of springs; Yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings.
> They go from strength to strength; Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.
> O Jehovah God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob.

Identities of mine: 
1. Christian
2. Software Engineer 
3. "Free" Software Researcher

As a Christian, Jesus Christ is my Shepherd. People who know me personally witness my sin. But I believe Jesus may pardon my sin and accept me in His kingdom. 

As a Software Engineer, I was trained to model business requirements into software solutions. Hands-on implementation is also my strength.

As a "free" software researcher, I love to explore novel ideas in fields like computation model and software testing.
